// Step - 1

// Linear Search 

// It is a sequential search algorithm
// This algorithm starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the 
// desired element is found; otherwise, the search continues till the end of the list.

// Binary Search 

// Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. 
// It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, 
// until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.


// Step - 2
